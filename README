OpenAI Agents
=============

Implementation of generative agents based on the paper "Generative Agents:
Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior". It's currently quite limited in scope
(only one agent, no interaction with the world), due to problems getting good
position information (section 5.1 in the paper) out of the language model.
